# Spending Tracker

## Project Description
Spending Tracker allows the user to record purchases â€“ listing details such as product/service name, price, purchase date, and category. Given a month and a year, it can calculate the user's total spending within that time frame. The viewing of all purchases ever recorded is also possible. As such, be sure to load the purchase log after opening the application and save it before quitting.

This was a term project for UBC's CPSC 210 Software Construction course. I was restricted in my choice of technology as the use of Java for programming, Swing for GUI creation, JUnit for testing, and JSON for storing persistent data were all required. However, I believe all of them were great choices for building my first application. Their straightforward nature allowed me to focus on building my software development skills without getting too overwhelmed by details.

## How to Install and Run It
Make sure you have a JDK installed and set up in your computer. To use the GUI version, run `src/main/ui/TrackerAppGUI.java`. To use the terminal version, run `src/main/ui/Main.java`.
