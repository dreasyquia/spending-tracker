# My Spending Tracker

## What It Does
The spending tracker can:
- **record** purchases, including paid services, made by the user with the price and the date of purchase.
- **categorize** purchases based on the kind of item or service paid for.
- **calculate** how much money was spent in a given month in a given year.

## Who Will Use it
This tracker will be most useful to individuals concerned about their spending habits. Thus, users will be *generally*
those in their twenties or older.

##Why This Project Interests Me
While not too overly complicated, a spending tracker has many possible features that can be added to improve the user's
experience. This is ideal as the project can start off simple and then be incrementally improved upon. As well, I often
have difficulty resisting the urge to spend my money and in turn, keeping track of all my purchases as a university 
student. Therefore, in addition to being a challenging project I wanted to take on, the spending tracker will also be a 
useful application to me after the term is over.
